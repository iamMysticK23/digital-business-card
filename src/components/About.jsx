            <p>I am a front end developer who has been passionate about technology for most of my life.
                My goal is to become a front end developer and continue to strengthen my skills in this field.
                I believe in "Take The Risk Or Lose The Chance." This basically means that if you don't take risks,
                you could be missing out on opportunities that could change your life.
